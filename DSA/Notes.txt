DSA & Algorithms

* Data structures is a named location that can be used to store and organize data.

examples: arrays (a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations)

* Algorithms - is a collection of steps to solve a problem.
- steps to a solution

example: Baking a pizza
    1. Heat oven to 550 Fahrenheit
    2. Knead the dough
    3. Add toppings

* Linear search - one by one, you examine the elements of an array to find a value

Why DSA?
- Writing code that is both time and memory efficient

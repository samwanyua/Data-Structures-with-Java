    /*
     * Graphs - non-linear aggregation of nodes and edges
     * Nodes(vertex) - contains data
     * Edges - connection between two nodes
     * Graphs - directed and undirected graphs
     * Undirected graphs - social network like facebook
     * When two nodes are connected - adjacency
     * Directed graphs - one way connection
     * ex. street maps
     * Rep. a graph : adjacency matrix, adjacency list
     * Adjacency matrix:
        * time complexity O(1)
        * space complexity O(n^2)
        Adjacency list
            * is an arraylist of linked lists
            * time complexity - O(n)
            * space complexity O(V + E)

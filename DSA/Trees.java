     * Trees
     * Is a non-linear data structure where nodes are organized in a hierachy
     * Has nodes and edges
     * Ex. of a tree - family tree
     * Application of trees:
     *      - File explorer
     *      - Databases
     *      - DNS (Domain Name Server)
     *      - Html DOM
     * Root node/parent - top of the tree, had no incoming edges but only outgoing edges
     * Leaf nodes/child - at the bottom of the tree, have no outgoing edges but have incoming edges
     * Branch n0des - have incoming and outgoing edges
     * Siblings - share the same parent
     * Subtree - is a smaller tree held within a larger tree
     * 
     * Size of a tree = # of nodes
     * Depth of a tree = # of edges below root node
     * Height of a tree = # of edges above the furthest leaf node
     *
